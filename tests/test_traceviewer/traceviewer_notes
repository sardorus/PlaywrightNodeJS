Trace Viewer is GUI tool that helps viewing the executed test along with snapshots, timeline and other traces

1. go to playwright.config.js file and make changes

# //retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  retries: 1,

# /* Collect trace when retrying the failed test. See https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer */
  trace: 'on-first-retry',

2. npx playwright show-trace test-results/test_traceviewer-traceViewer-tracetestviewer-chromium-retry1/trace.zip

# Trace Viewer Options
'on-first-retry' - record a trace only when retrying a test for the first time
'off' - do not record a trace
'on' - record a trace for each test (not recommended as its performance heavy)
'retain-on-failure' - record a trace for each test but remove it from successful test runs

# To set trace on from command 
npx playwright test --trace on
